# Python Client for the CoCalc API

## Configuration file

To get started you will need your CoCalc *account id* and an API key.

See [the API documentation](https://doc.cocalc.com/api/index.html).

Go to your "Account" tab, "Preferences", and look for "API key"

Put the API into a file in [YaML format](https://yaml.org), like this:

```
# Account settings for testing account.
first_name: Matthew
last_name: Brett
api_key: an_api_key
email: matthew.brett+cctesting@gmail.com
```
